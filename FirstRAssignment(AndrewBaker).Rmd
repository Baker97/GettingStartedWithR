# Task 2

This is _Baker97's_ first assignment for **Geog458**. Our course page can be accessed [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1269928).

# Task 3

![this is where I study](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2014/09/07214435/Signature_Stacked_Purple_Hex.png)
#Task 4

THis is the Pythagorean theorem[$$ (x^2 + y^2 = z^2) $$]

#Task 5

prime numbers  | even numbers
-------------- | ------------
            1  | 2
            3  | 4
            5  | 6

# Task 6

```{r}
100/10+2
100/(10+2)
32/2+24*(34-12)
(12222200/100)-25
300+23-223*(231)

# Task 7

x = 8*3
x + 10
y = (34-2)*5
y+x
z = 5+5+5+5-2*2
y+x+z
(x +10 * y)/2
```
# Task 8

firstSequence = seq(from = 1, to = 30, by = 1)
characterSequence = c("Andrew", "Winnie", "juan")

length(firstSequence)
length(characterSequence)
sum(firstSequence)
sum(characterSequence)

# Task 9

vector1 = seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)
vector2 = seq(from = 6, to = 10, by = 1)

vector1 + vector2
VectorMult = vector1 * vector2

# Task 10

combinedVector = c(vector1,vector2)

matrix1 = rbind(vector1, vector2, VectorMult)
matrix1

dataFrame1 = data.frame(matrix1, row.names = characterSequence)
dataFrame1

# Task 11

# Loading the Data
This is how to load data into R and how to convert it

# Task 12

```
chineseData = read.csv("China_EO_49to17.csv")

tibledChineseData = as_tibble(chineseData)
```
# Task 13

library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
chineseData = read.csv("China_EO_49to17.csv")
tibledChineseData = as_tibble(chineseData)

# Task 14
arrange(tibledChineseData,desc(year)


newFilteredChineseData = filter(select(tibledChineseData,c("Year","Shanghai_Enterprise",
"Shanghai_Output","Beijing_Enterprise","Beijing_Output")), Year >= 2000)

newFilteredChineseData

mutatedData = mutate(newFilteredChineseData,output_ratio = Beijing_Output/Shanghai_Output)
